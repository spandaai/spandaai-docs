# Spanda Platform: Fabric Vision

## Core Concept
- Distributed architecture connecting Platform, Domain, and Application layers.
- Nodes register into a global “mesh” for service discovery.

## Frameworks & Tools
- **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Nomad.
- **Networking:** Istio, Linkerd, Tailscale.
- **AI/ML:** Ray, KServe, TorchServe.

## Roadmap for Two-Node Deployment
1. Start with single-node.
2. Add a second node specialized for GPU.
3. Configure secure overlays and deploy services.

## Key Takeaways
- Start small, scale globally.
- Composable architecture for flexibility and scalability.
