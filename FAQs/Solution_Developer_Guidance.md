# Implementing a 3-Layered Framework

Implementing a 3-layered framework can significantly streamline your development process, especially when catering to diverse client needs across different domains.

Below, I provide a comprehensive guide on how engineers in the Solutions Team can effectively utilize this framework, using concrete examples from the EduTech domain for a university and the Supply Chain domain for a company like Nvidia.

## Understanding the 3-Layered Framework

Before diving into the practical application, it's essential to grasp the structure and purpose of each layer in the framework.

### 1. Platform Layer

**Purpose:**
Serves as the foundation, providing core services, utilities, and infrastructure components that are reusable across various domains and solutions.

**Components:**
- Core Services: Authentication, authorization, logging, monitoring, data connectors.
- Utilities: Common libraries, helper functions, configuration management.
- Infrastructure: APIs, databases, messaging systems, CI/CD pipelines.

### 2. Domain Layer

**Purpose:**
Contains domain-specific logic and components tailored to particular industries or sectors. This layer ensures that solutions align with the unique requirements and standards of each domain.

**Components:**
- Domain Models: Entities, value objects specific to the domain (e.g., Courses, Students in EduTech).
- Business Logic: Rules and processes that govern domain operations.
- Integrations: APIs or services that interact with domain-specific external systems.

### 3. Solutions Layer

**Purpose:**
Focuses on delivering customized solutions to clients by leveraging the Platform and Domain layers. This layer combines and configures components to meet specific client needs.

**Components:**
- Application Logic: Specific features and functionalities required by the client.
- Custom Integrations: Integrating client-specific systems or third-party services.
- Deployment Configurations: Environment-specific settings, deployment scripts.

## Applying the Framework: Step-by-Step Guide

Let's explore how an engineer in the Solutions Team can utilize this framework through two examples:
1. Developing an Edutech Application for a University
2. Solving a Supply Chain Problem for a Company like Nvidia

### Example 1: Edutech Application for a University

**Objective:**
Build a comprehensive online learning platform tailored for a university, featuring course management, student enrollment, virtual classrooms, and performance tracking.

#### Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

- Clone Necessary Repositories:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/spandaai/spandaai-platform.git
  git clone https://github.com/spandaai/spandaai-domain-edutech.git
  git clone https://github.com/spandaai/spandaai-solutions-university-edutech.git
  ```
- Ensure All Dependencies Are Installed:
  Navigate to each repository and install dependencies as per their respective README.md or setup scripts.

#### Step 2: Leveraging the Platform Layer

- Utilize Core Services:
  - **Authentication Service**: Implement secure user authentication using the platform's authentication module.
  - **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrate logging mechanisms to track application performance and errors.
  
  Example Integration in Python (Django-based):
  ```python
  # settings.py in spandaai-solutions-university-edutech
  INSTALLED_APPS = [
      ...
      'spandaai_platform.auth',
      'spandaai_platform.logging',
      ...
  ]

  AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
      'spandaai_platform.auth.backends.CustomAuthBackend',
      ...
  ]

  LOGGING = spandaai_platform.logging.get_logging_config()
  ```
- **Configuration Management**: Use platform-provided configuration utilities to manage environment variables and settings.
  ```bash
  # .env file
  PLATFORM_ENV=development
  DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/university_db
  ```

#### Step 3: Integrating the Domain Layer

- **Incorporate Domain Models**:
  - Courses, Students, Enrollments: Use domain-specific models to structure the data.
  
  Example Model in Django:
  ```python
  # models.py in spandaai-domain-edutech
  from django.db import models

  class Course(models.Model):
      title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
      description = models.TextField()
      credits = models.IntegerField()

  class Student(models.Model):
      first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
      last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
      email = models.EmailField(unique=True)

  class Enrollment(models.Model):
      student = models.ForeignKey(Student, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
      course = models.ForeignKey(Course, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
      enrollment_date = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)
  ```

- **Implement Business Logic**:
  - Enrollment Rules: Define rules such as prerequisites, maximum enrollments, etc.
  
  Example:
  ```python
  # services.py in spandaai-domain-edutech
  from .models import Enrollment, Course, Student

  def enroll_student(student_id, course_id):
      student = Student.objects.get(id=student_id)
      course = Course.objects.get(id=course_id)

      # Check prerequisites
      if course.credits > 3 and not student.has_completed_prerequisite(course):
          raise Exception("Prerequisite not met.")

      # Check maximum enrollments
      if Enrollment.objects.filter(course=course).count() >= course.max_enrollments:
          raise Exception("Course is full.")

      Enrollment.objects.create(student=student, course=course)
  ```

#### Step 4: Developing the Solution Layer

- **Customize Application Logic**:
  - Virtual Classrooms: Develop features for live classes, recordings, and interactive sessions.
  
  Example:
  ```python
  # views.py in spandaai-solutions-university-edutech
  from django.shortcuts import render
  from .models import Course

  def virtual_classroom(request, course_id):
      course = Course.objects.get(id=course_id)
      sessions = course.sessions.all()
      return render(request, 'virtual_classroom.html', {'course': course, 'sessions': sessions})
  ```

- **Integrate Third-Party Services**:
  - Video Conferencing: Integrate with Zoom or Google Meet APIs for virtual classrooms.
  
  Example Integration:
  ```python
  # services.py in spandaai-solutions-university-edutech
  import requests

  def create_zoom_meeting(course_id):
      course = Course.objects.get(id=course_id)
      response = requests.post(
          'https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/me/meetings',
          headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {ZOOM_JWT_TOKEN}'},
          json={
              'topic': course.title,
              'type': 2,  # Scheduled meeting
              'start_time': '2024-01-01T10:00:00',
              'duration': 60,
              'timezone': 'America/New_York',
          }
      )
      meeting = response.json()
      return meeting['join_url']
  ```

#### Step 5: Consuming the Layers as Libraries

- **Package Platform and Domain Layers as Python Packages**:
  Ensure that spandaai-platform and spandaai-domain-edutech are structured as installable Python packages.

  Example setup.py for Platform Layer:
  ```python
  # spandaai-platform/setup.py
  from setuptools import setup, find_packages

  setup(
      name='spandaai-platform',
      version='1.0.0',
      packages=find_packages(),
      install_requires=[
          # Define dependencies
      ],
  )
  ```

- **Install Platform and Domain Packages in Solutions Layer**:
  ```bash
  # From spandaai-solutions-university-edutech directory
  pip install -e ../spandaai-platform
  pip install -e ../spandaai-domain-edutech
  ```

- **Import and Use in Solution Code**:
  ```python
  # views.py in spandaai-solutions-university-edutech
  from spandaai_platform.auth import authenticate_user
  from spandaai_domain_edutech.services import enroll_student

  def enroll_view(request):
      user = authenticate_user(request)
      if user.is_authenticated:
          enroll_student(user.id, request.POST['course_id'])
          return redirect('success')
      else:
          return redirect('login')
  ```

#### Step 6: Testing and Deployment

- **Run Automated Tests**:

  Example Model:
  ```python
  # models.py in spandaai-domain-supplychain
  from django.db import models

  class Inventory(models.Model):
      product = models.CharField(max_length=255)
      quantity = models.IntegerField()
      location = models.CharField(max_length=255)

  class Supplier(models.Model):
      name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
      contact_email = models.EmailField()
      api_endpoint = models.URLField()

  class Order(models.Model):
      supplier = models.ForeignKey(Supplier, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
      product = models.CharField(max_length=255)
      quantity = models.IntegerField()
      order_date = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)
  ```

- **Implement Business Logic**:
  - Demand Forecasting: Use statistical models or machine learning algorithms to predict product demand.
  
  Example:
  ```python
  # services.py in spandaai-domain-supplychain
  import numpy as np
  from .models import Inventory, Order

  def forecast_demand(product_id, period):
      orders = Order.objects.filter(product=product_id).order_by('order_date')
      data = [order.quantity for order in orders]
      # Simple Moving Average for demonstration
      if len(data) < period:
          return np.mean(data)
      return np.mean(data[-period:])
  ```

#### Step 4: Developing the Solution Layer

- **Customize Application Logic**:
  - Inventory Management Dashboard: Develop interfaces to monitor and manage inventory levels.
  
  Example:
  ```python
  # views.py in spandaai-solutions-nvidia-supplychain
  from django.shortcuts import render
  from spandaai_domain_supplychain.models import Inventory

  def inventory_dashboard(request):
      inventories = Inventory.objects.all()
      return render(request, 'inventory_dashboard.html', {'inventories': inventories})
  ```

- **Integrate Supplier Systems**:
  - Automated Order Placement: Automatically place orders with suppliers based on inventory thresholds and demand forecasts.
  
  Example Integration:
  ```python
  # services.py in spandaai-solutions-nvidia-supplychain
  import requests
  from spandaai_domain_supplychain.models import Supplier, Order

  def place_order_if_needed(product_id):
      inventory = Inventory.objects.get(product=product_id)
      forecast = forecast_demand(product_id, period=3)
      if inventory.quantity < forecast:
          supplier = Supplier.objects.get(product=product_id)
          order_quantity = forecast * 2  # Example logic
          response = requests.post(
              supplier.api_endpoint,
              json={'product': product_id, 'quantity': order_quantity},
              headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {SUPPLIER_API_KEY}'}
          )
          if response.status_code == 200:
              Order.objects.create(supplier=supplier, product=product_id, quantity=order_quantity)
  ```
