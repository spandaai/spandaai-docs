3. Workflow Overview
To ensure smooth development cycles from feature definition to deployment, we've established a structured workflow encompassing the following stages:

Defining a Feature
Identify Requirements: Collaborate with stakeholders to outline feature requirements.
Create JIRA Issue: Log the feature as a JIRA issue under the appropriate project and category.
Planning and Assignment
Assign to Team Member: Assign the JIRA issue to the relevant team member based on expertise.
Estimate Effort: Estimate the time and resources required to implement the feature.
Development
Branching Strategy: Create a feature branch in the respective repository using Gitflow or a similar strategy.

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b feature/feature-name
Implement Feature: Develop the feature following coding standards and best practices.

Commit Changes: Commit changes with meaningful messages linking to JIRA issues.

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Add [feature]: Description of your changes"
Testing
Write Tests: Develop unit and integration tests to ensure feature reliability.
Run Tests: Execute tests locally and ensure they pass.
Continuous Integration: Automated tests run via CI/CD pipelines upon push.
Code Review
Pull Request: Open a pull request (PR) for the feature branch to merge into the main branch.
Peer Review: Team members review the PR, provide feedback, and request changes if necessary.
Approve and Merge: Once approved, merge the PR into the main branch.
Deployment
Continuous Deployment: Automated deployment pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) deploy the feature to staging and production environments.
Verification: Post-deployment testing to ensure feature operates as expected.
Monitoring and Feedback
Monitor Performance: Use monitoring tools (Grafana, Prometheus) to track feature performance.
Gather Feedback: Collect user feedback for continuous improvement.
4. Team Roles and Responsibilities
Efficient task management relies on clearly defined roles within each team:

Product Managers

5. Task Tracking with JIRA
5.1. Setting Up JIRA for SpandaAI
JIRA is a robust project management tool that facilitates issue tracking, project planning, and workflow automation. Here's how to set it up for SpandaAI:

Create JIRA Projects:
Central Documentation Project: Manage documentation-related tasks.
Platform Development Project: Handle platform-specific features and bugs.
Domain Applications Project: Manage tasks for Edutech, HRTech, and SportsTech domains.
Management and Infrastructure Project: Oversee CI/CD, infrastructure, and monitoring tasks.
Define Issue Types:
Epic: Large bodies of work encompassing multiple features or tasks.
Story: User-centric features or functionalities.
Task: General tasks or maintenance work.
Bug: Defects or issues needing resolution.
Customize Workflows:
To Do → In Progress → In Review → Done
Add statuses as needed (e.g., Testing, Blocked)
Set Up Components and Labels:
Components: Segment projects into logical parts (e.g., Frontend, Backend, Documentation).
Labels: Tag issues for easier filtering and reporting.
Integrate with GitHub:
Use JIRA's GitHub integration to link commits, branches, and pull requests to JIRA issues.
Automatically transition JIRA issues based on GitHub activities.
5.2. Managing Tasks
Creating Issues:
Product Managers create issues for new features, bugs, or tasks.
Assign issues to relevant team members.
Tracking Progress:
Use JIRA boards (Kanban or Scrum) to visualize task statuses.
Monitor sprint progress and adjust priorities as needed.
Reporting and Analytics:
Utilize JIRA's reporting tools to gain insights into team performance, sprint velocity, and project health.
5.3. Automating Workflows in JIRA
To enhance efficiency, consider automating repetitive tasks and workflows:

Automated Issue Transitions:
Automatically move issues to "In Progress" when a branch is created.
Transition issues to "Done" when a PR is merged.
Notifications:
Set up notifications for issue assignments, status changes, and comments.
Integration with CI/CD:
Link JIRA issues with CI/CD pipelines to trigger deployments upon issue completion.
Custom Scripts:
Utilize JIRA's REST API to create custom automation scripts for specific needs.
5.4. Example Automation Rules
When a PR is opened:

Automatically link the PR to the corresponding JIRA issue.
Transition the issue to "In Review".
When a PR is merged:

Transition the JIRA issue to "Done".
Trigger deployment pipelines.
When an issue is closed:

Notify the team via Slack or email.
6. Integrating JIRA with GitHub
Seamless integration between JIRA and GitHub ensures that development activities are accurately reflected in project management:

Use JIRA's GitHub Integration App:
Install the GitHub for JIRA app from the Atlassian Marketplace.
Connect your GitHub repositories to JIRA projects.
Linking Commits and PRs:
Reference JIRA issue keys in commit messages and PR titles to automatically link them.

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "SPANDAAI-123: Implement user authentication feature"
Automated Status Updates:
Configure JIRA to update issue statuses based on GitHub actions (e.g., transitioning to "In Review" when a PR is opened).
Visibility and Traceability:
View linked commits, branches, and PRs directly within JIRA issues for comprehensive traceability.
7. Automating Task Tracking and Workflow
Automation reduces manual effort and minimizes errors. Here are strategies to automate task tracking and workflows:

7.1. GitHub Actions for Automation
Leverage GitHub Actions to automate interactions between GitHub and JIRA:

Automate Issue Creation:
Automatically create JIRA issues from GitHub events (e.g., new feature branches).
Update Issue Statuses:
Use Actions to transition JIRA issues based on GitHub events (e.g., PR opened, merged).
Notifications:
Send notifications to team channels (Slack, Microsoft Teams) upon issue or PR updates.
7.2. Example GitHub Action Workflow
Below is an example of a GitHub Action that transitions a JIRA issue to "In Progress" when a branch is created:

yaml
Copy code
name: Transition JIRA Issue to In Progress

on:
  create:
    branches:
      - feature/*

jobs:
  transition_issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Extract JIRA Issue Key
        id: extract
        run: |
          ISSUE_KEY=$(echo "${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/}" | grep -oE '[A-Z]+-[0-9]+')
          echo "::set-output name=issue_key::$ISSUE_KEY"

      - name: Transition Issue in JIRA
        uses: atlassian/gajira-action@v2
        with:
          issue: ${{ steps.extract.outputs.issue_key }}
          transition: 'In Progress'
        env:
          JIRA_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.JIRA_BASE_URL }}
          JIRA_USER_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.JIRA_USER_EMAIL }}
          JIRA_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JIRA_API_TOKEN }}
Notes:

Secrets: Store sensitive information like JIRA_API_TOKEN in GitHub Secrets.
Transition Names: Ensure transition names match exactly with those defined in JIRA workflows.
7.3. Utilizing JIRA Automation Rules
JIRA offers built-in automation capabilities to streamline workflows:

Create Automation Rules:
Navigate to Project Settings > Automation.
Define triggers, conditions, and actions for various scenarios.
Sample Automation Rules:
Transition on PR Merge:
Trigger: PR merged in GitHub.
Action: Transition linked JIRA issue to "Done".
Assign Issues Automatically:
Trigger: New issue created.
Condition: Issue type is "Bug".
Action: Assign to QA Engineer.
Use Smart Values:
Leverage JIRA's smart values to access issue and event data within automation rules.
8. Recommendations for Effective Task Tracking
